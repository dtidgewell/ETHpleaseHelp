# ETHpleaseHelp

I have created this repository specifically to communicate with the user Haxtro. Haxtro, if you are reading this,
I saw your post where you said that you have a file of 28,000 words that you used to recover your ETH wallet password.
I couldn't find another way to message you this, but could you share that file with me? I have a lot of ETH I need to
recover and I would be incredibly grateful if you could help me out.
